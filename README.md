# Description

The main objective of the JavaScript capstone project is to create a personalized web application utilizing an external API. The API selected by each individual student will provide information regarding a specific subject of their choice, which will then be incorporated into the development of the web application. Additionally, the web application will consist of two different user interfaces.

The website's main page displays a selection of items that you have the option to "like." Also, there is a popup window available that provides additional details about each item, enabling you to leave a comment or reserve the item for a specified duration.

## Built With
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git, GitHub, Webpack, Webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server
